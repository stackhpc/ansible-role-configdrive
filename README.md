ansible-role-configdrive
========================

**Currently this repo is not being actively maintained. I suggest you use
the fork maintained by David Blaisonneau: https://gitlab.com/davidblaisonneau-orange/ansible-role-configdrive**

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ansible role to create config-drives for OpenStack Ironic. 
It creates OpenStack config-drives data for nodes and it is able
to setup complex networking configuration like bonding, vlans 
and bridges on Debian and RedHat based distributions. Note 
that the images have to have support for those features 
(kernel modules, packages, ...). This tool just create the 
configuration files which are going to be injected in the host at 
boot time using Cloud-Init.

This playbook is intended to be executed prior to the deployments 
of nodes via Ironic. It creates a basic configuration drive 
containing network configuration, a SSH key permitting the 
user to login to the host, and other files like `/etc/hosts` or 
`/etc/resolv.conf`. Also, it is able to include user_data 
file https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit


Ansible 2.0, works with Ubuntu Jammy and above, RHEL 8 and above.


Requirements
------------

It does not install packages on the target host, it just creates the 
folders and files needed to create a config-drive volume, So, be 
aware that you probably you will need to install `xorriso`,
`base64` and `gzip`.
